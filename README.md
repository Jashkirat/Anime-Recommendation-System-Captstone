# Fraud-Detection-ML
## Capstone Project - ML Fraud Detection

## Introduction
In today's digital age, credit card transactions have become a part of our daily routine. While the convenience of quick payments is great, the risk of fraudulent activities is also increasing. Credit card fraud includes many illicit activities, such as unauthorized purchases and identity theft. The impact of such fraud is far-reaching, affecting not only individuals but also financial institutions and the overall economy.

To address this pressing issue, my project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing patterns and anomalies in transaction data, our model seeks to provide a robust security measure that enhances the trustworthiness of credit card transactions.

### Problem Statement
The goal is to build a fraud detection system that quickly and reliably spots illegal transactions while minimizing the inconvenience to customers by avoiding false positives.

### Opportunity
We want to build a model that can accurately anticipate fraud by using a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle. Our goal is to increase transaction security, reduce losses, and rebuild confidence in electronic payments so that credit card fraud will become less common in the future.

## Goals
1. Build a fraud detection system that helps institutions to prevent fraud and maintain trust of customers.
2. To decrease the number of legitimate transactions that are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent.
3. To improve the precision of the fraud detection model so that it can identify fraudulent transactions with a higher success rate.

## Impact of the Project
1. Enhanced Security
2. Reduce Financial Loss
3. Improved User Experience

## Introduction to Dataset
The dataset includes the following variables:
- Distance from Home: The distance between the cardholder's home and the transaction location.
- Distance from Last Transaction: The geographical distance between this transaction and the previous one.
- Ratio to Median Purchase Price: The transaction's cost compared to the median purchase price.
- Repeat Retailer: Indicates if the transaction was with a retailer used previously.
- Used Chip: Specifies if the transaction was processed using a chip-enabled card.
- Used PIN Number: Indicates whether a PIN was used for the transaction.
- Online Order: Whether the transaction was conducted online.
- Fraud: Flags if the transaction was fraudulent.

### Further refinements needed
- Clean the data.
- Narrow down the data: I propose narrowing it down to a specific age group, such as Senior Citizens or individuals over the age of 50, as they are more commonly targeted by fraudsters.
- Investigate additional features: Explore the possibility of incorporating additional features such as transaction frequency, time of transaction, and spending habits to enhance the model's accuracy.
